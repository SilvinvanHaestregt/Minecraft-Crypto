# When you update the plugin, this file gets downloaded and almost immediately deleted.
# First the main plugin gets disabled and then there is a short 2 second wait.
# After that the disabled main plugin file gets deleted and immediately replaced by the new version
# Then when the new file is downloaded it will be reloaded.
# The deletion of this file happens in the main plugin file.

# Note: The deletion of the main plugin file doesn't result into your playerdata files being deleted!
